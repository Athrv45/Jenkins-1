Reflection on How CI Improves Software Development:

 -Continuous Integration (CI) enhances software development by promoting collaboration,
 automation, anrapid feedback. By frequently integrating code,
 developers catch and fix issues early, reducing defects and saving time.
 CI automates tasks like testing and building, ensuring new code doesnâ€™t break existing 
 functionality. This rapid feedback loop improves code quality and stability. It also encourages
 better teamwork, allowing developers to merge changes frequently and resolve conflicts early.
 CI enforces coding standards and maintains a consistent workflow, creating a solid foundation for 
 faster, more reliable releases. Overall, CI makes the development process more efficient, agile,
 and aligned with delivering high-quality software.
